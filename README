This is the General Mediation Engine (GME) project. 
Work began on March 7th, 2014 by Justus Robertson.

---------------

0. REAMDE

This is a software framework for producing interactive narratives using narrative mediation. This project also contains a text interface for the engine and a suite of unit tests.

---------------

1. Important Warning

In order for the system to work correctly, it needs a planner to generate linear narratives. The system is compatible with an off the shelf planner, called Fast Downward, and a specialized narrative planner, called Glaive. GME users will have to install at least one of these two planners to run the framework.

2. Fast Downward Installation Instructions

This section details how to install and run Fast Downward on a Windows 10 machine.

Step 1: Download Fast Downward from Mercurial. Travel to the following link:
http://hg.fast-downward.org/rev/e6caa678ba36

and click 'zip' in the sidebar. More information about Fast Downward can be found here:
http://www.fast-downward.org/ObtainingAndRunningFastDownward

Step 1: Install 32-bit Cygwin installer. Make sure it's the 32-bit installer, no matter what version of Windows you have!
www.cygwin.com/install.html
www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe

Step 2: When running the installer, search for and install each of these packages:
mercurial
g++
make
python
flex
bison
gawk
gcc

Step 3: Once installed, open Cygwin and navigate to Fast Downward's source directory. Type:
cd /cygdrive/c/... path to the GME project .../fastdownward/src

Step 4: Compile FastDownward by typing:
./build_all

---------------

3. Glaive Installation Instructions

This section details how to install and run Glaive.

Step 1: Download the Glaive JAR file from this website:
http://stephengware.com/projects/glaive/

Step 2: Place the Glaive JAR file inside the GME project in a directory called 'Glaive'.

Step 3: Create a folder in the Glaive directory called 'output'.
